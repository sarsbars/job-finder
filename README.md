# Job Finder: Your Professional Network

This is the final project for the Third Party API course, a web application inspired by LinkedIn, built using the Random User API to populate user profiles.

## Project Features

-   **User Login:** A dedicated login page where users can enter their credentials. Login information is stored locally for authentication.
-   **Homepage:** A 3-column layout featuring a header, footer, and sections for the main user profile and connections/suggestions.
-   **Local Storage Authentication:** User credentials are stored in `localStorage`, and the system authenticates users against this stored data upon login.
-   **Main User Profile:** A manually added profile section for the primary user (you), including your picture and personal data.
-   **Connections/Suggestions:** Displays at least 10 user profiles fetched from the Random User API, showing their profile pictures, full names, and cities.
-   **Consistent Design:** Maintains a uniform visual style across all pages, including colors, fonts, and layout elements.

## Technologies Used
